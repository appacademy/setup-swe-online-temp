# Setting Up Your Computer For App Academy

In order to be successful in the course, your computer needs to be setup in a
very specific way. If the setup is correct, you will not waste your time
fighting the setup of tools and applications, so you can concentrate on the new
material you are learning.

## The Four Phases of Tech Setup

Setting up your computer can sometimes feel overwhelming! Because of that, these
setup instructions are broken into a series of phases to help you install only
the software you need, when you need it. This will allow you to jump into
learning to code faster.

## Phase 1: Learning Challenges Setup

To complete the Learning Challenges during the SWE Online admissions process,
you need to install __Google Chrome__, __Visual Studio Code__, and __Git__.

Instructions for completing this setup for Mac, Windows, and Linux users are
included within the "Online Learning and Challenge Modules" course.

## Phase 2: Prep Work Setup

To continue working with Git in Prep Work, you will need to set up a
__GitHub__ account so you can start working with remote repositories. You will
also need to install __Node__ and __Mocha__ to complete the second
half of the Prepwork.

Instructions for completing this setup are included within the "Prep Work"
course.

## Phase 3: Module 1 Setup

On the first day of the course, time is set aside to finish setting up your
computer, and testing out your setup to confirm everything works.

This phase will include different tasks depending on two factors; your operating
system, and whether or not you completed Phase 2 setup for Prep Work.

Use the guide below to determine which steps you have already completed, and
which steps you need to complete to be ready for the course:

### Mac or Linux Users

___Option 1___: _If you are using a new or different computer than you used for the Learning
Challenges:_

- [ ] Complete Phase 1 setup
- [ ] Complete Phase 2 setup
- [ ] Complete [Tech Setup Check practice] to confirm everything works

__Option 2__: _If you completed Learning Challenges, but not Prep Work:_

- [ ] Complete Phase 2 setup
- [ ] Complete [Tech Setup Check practice] to confirm everything works

__Option 3__: _If you completed some of Prep Work, but not all, you will need to install
    any of the following software that you have not yet installed:_

- [ ] GitHub
- [ ] nvm and Node
- [ ] Mocha

__Option 4__: _If you completed Learning Challenges and ALL of Prep Work:_

- [ ] Complete [Tech Setup Check practice] to confirm everything works

### Windows Users

In the Learning Challenges and Prep Work, you used __Git For Windows__ which
allowed you to use UNIX-style commands on your Windows machine. This approach
allowed you to speed up the setup process and was sufficient for completing the
Learning Challenges and Prep Work, but this approach is not sufficient for
completing all of the practices and assessments for the course.

In Phase 3, all Windows students will need to install __Windows Subsystem for
Linux__ (WSL) and make some configuration changes to the rest of the setup to
make sure everything works through WSL.

Complete the following steps:

- [ ] Complete Phase 3 setup for Windows (WSL)
    - [ ] Install WSL
    - [ ] Update phase 1 installations
    - [ ] Update phase 2 installations
- [ ] Complete [Tech Setup Check practice] to confirm everything works through
  WSL

### Phase 4: Python and Docker Setup

The setup instructions above include most of the software you will need to
complete modules one through five of the course.

In Module 6, you will need to install __Python__ and __Docker__. These do not
need to be installed prior to starting Module 6.
