# Environment Setup II - Mac, Windows, and Linux

You'll need to install a few more development tools to complete this Prep Work.
__You must complete this setup even if you completed the setup for the Learning
Challenges!__

## Required Software for Prep Work

You've already installed Visual Studio Code, Google Chrome, and Git which
allowed you to work locally on your HTML and CSS project. To continue working
with Git, you will now need to set up a __GitHub__ account so you can start
working with remote repositories. You will also need to install __Node__
and __Mocha__ to complete the second half of this Prep Work.

The instructions for the software described above are included right before you
start the lessons in which the software is needed, with detailed instructions
for both Mac and Windows operating systems.

## A reminder about Linux

__If you are working in a Linux environment, you will need to figure out and
make the specific configurations necessary to get everything working on your
device.__

Keep in mind that Linux is not officially supported at App Academy. If you
struggle with your Linux setup in Prep Work, you are strongly encouraged to
switch to a Mac or Windows environment so you can benefit from Prepwork Mentor
and Instructor support with your environment setup.
