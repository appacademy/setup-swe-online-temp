# Update Phase 1 Installations

Now that you have WSL installed, it's time to check the software that you
installed in your prep work. You need to make sure that you can access this
software.

## Google Chrome

Check that Google Chrome is installed and working properly by finding it in
Windows Explorer, and double-click to open it.

## Visual Studio Code

Check that Visual Studio Code is installed and working properly by finding it
in Windows Explorer, and double-click to open it.

If either Google Chrome or Visual Studio Code are not installed or you cannot
access them, install them using instructions in your prep work. If you run into
trouble, talk to an instructor for support.
