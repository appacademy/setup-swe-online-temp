# Environment Setup I - Linux

You'll need to install some basic development tools for this program. We've
provided brief instructions, but if you are using Linux, it's up to you to find
and use the correct method to set up the software for your specific implementation
and settings.

## The responsibility of choosing Linux

With great power (and a price tag of zero) comes great responsibility.  __If you
choose to use Linux as your development platform, you're taking on complete
responsibility to figure out and make the specific configurations necessary to
get everything working on your device.__

If you don't know what that means and don't already have an approach in mind, it
is best to use Windows or Mac for this experience.  Learning to be a developer
is extremely challenging and struggling with Linux environment issues will add
to that.

You'll notice that our instructions for Linux are much briefer than for other
operating systems.  This is because many steps need to be adjusted to work on
different implementations of Linux.  There may be different commands, different
files, or additional steps.

## Required Software

You will need to have __Visual Studio Code__ and __Google Chrome__ installed on
your computer. Visit the sites below for guidance on installing this software for
your Linux environment.

- [Visual Studio Code]
- [Google Chrome]

> _Note: You may need to do some trouble-shooting to get your setup to work.
> Keep in mind that Linux is not officially supported at App Academy. If you
> struggle with your Linux setup, you are strongly encouraged to switch to a Mac
> or Windows environment so you can benefit from instructor support with your
> environment setup._
